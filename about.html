          <p>CNN-News18 (originally CNN-IBN) is an Indian English-language news television channel founded by Rajdeep Sardesai located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. It is currently owned by Network 18. CNN provides international coverage for the channel, while Indian Broadcasting Network concentrates on Indian and local reports. In May 2014, Reliance Industries announced it would be taking over Network18. The move was touted as "the biggest-ever deal in the Indian media space".Reliance Industries already had indirect control of the TV18 network by virtue of investments it made in Network18 starting from January 2012.</p>
          <p>CNN International only reached urban elites in India. To reach the Indian masses Time Warner together with an Indian company, Global Broadcast News (currently TV18 Broadcast Limited), launched the channel in India as CNN-IBN on 18 December 2005. The channel was completely run by TV18 Broadcast Limited, which only used the Cable News Network (CNN) brand name.Currently, Time Warner's India-specific CNN-News18 is watched by more people than its CNN International sister network, although both channels are in English. According to Network 18, since its inception, the channel has been reaching out to an average of 45 million households every day.In 2015, it was announced that a licensing agreement between Turner Broadcasting and Network 18 had not been renewed and would expire in January 2016.On 1 December 2015, it was announced the brand licensing had been renewed for another term.At 7:57pm, 18 April 2016, CNN-IBN rebranded as CNN-News18.</p>
